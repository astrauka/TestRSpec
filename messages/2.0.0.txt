⚠️ Please restart Sublime Text.

Changes:

* ⚠️ BREAKING CHANGE: TestRSpec 2.0 no longer ships with default key bindings.

To keep the old key bindings, go to Preferences -> Package Settings ->
TestRSpec -> Key Bindings, then copy the parts you need to your key binding
configuration file.

* Use the default color scheme for RSpec output panel. If you use a light
theme, you'll notice the output is now light as well.

You might need to reset `panel_settings` override in TestRSpec settings if
you've changed those.

* Improve failed spec detection in output panel. If you've previously set
`show_errors_inline` to false in your settings because of this plugin, you
might want to reenable it.

* Refuse to run files that are not specs or when spec folder cannot be found.

* Make the plugin compatible with future automatic upgrades.
