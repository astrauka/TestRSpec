Quick Start
===========

TestRSpec allows you to run RSpec from within Sublime Text.

TestRSpec tries its best to autodetect how to run RSpec. However, you might need
to make adjustments to plugin's configuration if you have an uncommon setup.

There are no key bindings enabled by default. Go to Preferences ->
Package Settings -> TestRSpec -> Key Bindings to define key bindings.
